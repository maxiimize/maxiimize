# Hi, I’m Max 👋

I’m a **full-stack product builder** and system development student, currently working on my own startup project, **ForeC.gg**.

I enjoy building products that feel real — not just demos — where backend architecture, data, and and AI are used to solve concrete problems and create value.

Open to **backend, full-stack, or product-oriented engineering roles**.

## 💼 Current role
**Full-Stack Engineering Intern — Podmanager.ai**

- Building and maintaining product features using **Python** and **React**
- Working close to real users and production systems
- Contributing across both backend and frontend in a startup environment

## ⭐ Featured Project — ForeC.gg (private repository)
**AI-powered esports match predictions**

ForeC.gg is an AI-driven platform that predicts outcomes for **CS2, League of Legends, and Dota 2** using real-time esports data.

The project is part startup, part engineering challenge — built to function as a real product rather than a school assignment.

**My role**
- Designed and implemented the backend architecture
- Built REST APIs with ASP.NET Core
- Designed data models and database structure
- Integrated AI models for prediction logic
- Ingested and processed real-world match data for decision-making

Frontend and UI are developed by a teammate, while I focus on backend, data, and AI.

🔒 Repository currently private while development is ongoing.
