# Hi, I’m Max 👋

I’m a **full-stack product builder** and system development student, currently working on my own startup project, **ForeC.gg**.

I enjoy building products that feel real — not just demos — where backend architecture, data, and AI are used to solve concrete problems and create value.

My current goal is to become employed as soon as possible in **Riga, Latvia**, ideally in a role where I can work close to the product and its technical core.

## ⭐ Featured Project — ForeC.gg (private repository)
**AI-powered esports match predictions**

ForeC.gg is an AI-driven platform that predicts outcomes for **CS2, League of Legends, and Dota 2** using real-time esports data.

The project is part startup, part engineering challenge — built to function as a real product rather than a school assignment.

**My role**
- Designed and implemented the backend architecture
- Built REST APIs with ASP.NET Core
- Designed data models and database structure
- Integrated AI models for prediction logic
- Ingested and processed real-world match data for decision-making

Frontend and UI are developed by a teammate, while I focus on backend, data, and AI.

🔒 Repository currently private while development is ongoing.
